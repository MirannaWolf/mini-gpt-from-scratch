A Most Perplexing Peach
Characters:

LORD ALARIC: A nobleman, vexed.
LADY ISOLDE: His wife, pragmatic.
GRUMIO: A servant, easily confused.
(The scene opens in a dimly lit chamber. LORD ALARIC paces fretfully, clutching a bruised peach.)

LORD ALARIC:
To eat, or not to eat, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of a peach most bruised,
Or to take arms against a sea of fruit,
And by opposing end them? To chew, to swallow—
No more; and by a chew to say we end
The stomach-ache and thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To chew, to swallow—
Ay, there's the rub, for in that simple bite
What indigestion dire may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause.

(LADY ISOLDE enters, observing him with a raised eyebrow.)

LADY ISOLDE:
My Lord, what tempest rages in thy soul?
Is it the taxman, or some foreign king?
Or perchance, the cook hath burnt thy morning toast?

LORD ALARIC:
(Gesturing wildly with the peach)
Behold, Isolde, this orb of fleshy dread!
'Twas promised ripe, a succulent delight,
Yet now, 'tis mottled, bruised, a very blight
Upon my breakfast dreams! A tragedy,
More dire than any Caesar’s fall, I swear!

LADY ISOLDE:
(Takes the peach, inspects it briefly)
Alaric, dear husband, 'tis but a peach.
A simple blemish doth not damn the fruit.
Cut off the bruised part, and the rest is sweet.
Or give it Grumio.

(She hands the peach to GRUMIO, who has just entered, looking bewildered.)

GRUMIO:
(To himself, examining the peach)
A peach? Or not a peach? This colour's strange.
Methinks the fairies danced upon its skin.
Perchance 'tis poisoned? Or a magic charm?
My lord, my lady, pray, what is its fate?

LORD ALARIC:
(Sighing dramatically, but with a hint of resignation)
Its fate, good Grumio, is in thy maw.
Eat it, or discard it! The drama's done!
My appetite for high philosophy
Hath vanished, like a shadow in the sun.

LADY ISOLDE:
(Smiling gently)
Come, love, let us find a fresh, unblemished plum.
The world holds more than one bruised peach, I trust.

(LORD ALARIC nods, still slightly miffed. GRUMIO cautiously takes a small bite of the peach, then shrugs.)

(FADE TO BLACK.)
